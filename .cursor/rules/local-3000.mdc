# Local 3000 Dev Server

When the user asks to "load on local 3000", "run local 3000", "start local 3000", or similar:

1. **Kill everything on port 3000** – Run `pnpm run:3000` (or `bash scripts/run-web-3000.sh`). This script:
   - Kills all processes on port 3000
   - Kills any orphaned `next dev` processes
   - Starts Next.js at http://127.0.0.1:3000

2. **Run in background** – Start the dev server as a background process so it keeps running.

3. **Do not ask** – Execute immediately; do not prompt for confirmation.
